Method 1: Use nano inside VS Code Terminal (Recommended for learning Linux)
Step 1: Open the VS Code terminal

In VS Code:

Press `Ctrl + `` (backtick)
OR

Go to Terminal → New Terminal

This opens a Linux/WSL terminal at the bottom of VS Code.

Step 2: Navigate to your project folder

Example:

cd Alx_DjangoLearnLab


(Use ls to confirm where you are.)

Step 3: Create a file using nano
nano example.txt


If the file does not exist, nano creates it

If it exists, nano opens it

Step 4: Write your content

Just start typing inside nano.

Step 5: Save and exit nano

Save: Ctrl + O → press Enter

Exit: Ctrl + X

Step 6: Open the file in VS Code editor

Now open it visually:

code example.txt


Or just click it in the Explorer panel in VS Code.

Method 2: Create file directly in VS Code (No nano)

If your goal is simply to create a file (not practice Linux):

Open Explorer in VS Code

Click New File

Name it (e.g. example.txt)

Start typing

��� This is the VS Code way.

When should you use nano?

Use nano when:

You’re practicing Linux commands (ALX, backend training, servers)

You SSH into a server where VS Code UI isn’t available

You want quick edits from terminal

Use VS Code editor when:

Writing real project code

Debugging

Working with Django / Python apps

Quick summary
