# í·© Python Code Challenge 2: Sales & Inventory Analyzer

## í·  Scenario

Youâ€™re building a **simple inventory and sales analyzer** for a small shop.

Each product has:

* a name
* quantity sold
* unit price

Youâ€™ll analyze performance using **lists, tuples, sets, integers, and operators**.

---

## í³Œ Given Data

```python
products = ["rice", "beans", "yam", "rice", "beans", "oil", "yam"]
quantities = [10, 5, 8, 6, 7, 3, 2]
prices = [500, 300, 200, 500, 300, 1000, 200]
```

> Each index represents **one sale**
> Example: `"rice", 10, 500` â†’ 10 bags of rice sold at â‚¦500 each

---

## í¾¯ Tasks

### 1ï¸âƒ£ List & Integer Operations

* Calculate **total items sold**
* Calculate **total revenue**

---

### 2ï¸âƒ£ Set Operations

* Extract **unique products**
* Count how many **different products** were sold

---

### 3ï¸âƒ£ Tuple Operations

Create a tuple for **each sale** in this format:

```python
(product_name, quantity, price, revenue)
```

Store all tuples in a list.

---

### 4ï¸âƒ£ Operator & Conditional Logic

* Count how many sales generated **revenue greater than â‚¦3000**
* Apply a **10% discount** to sales where quantity â‰¥ 8
* Use comparison and arithmetic operators

---

### 5ï¸âƒ£ Membership & Logical Operators

* Check if `"oil"` was sold
* Check if `"salt"` was sold
* Use `and` / `or` at least once

---

## í´¥ Bonus (Optional)

* Find the **highest revenue sale**
* Sort sales by revenue (highest â†’ lowest)
* Use a **ternary operator** for discount logic

---

## í·ª Rules

âŒ No external libraries
âŒ No AI autocomplete
âœ… Clean Python only

---
