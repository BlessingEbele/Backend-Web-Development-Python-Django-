# working with Numeric data in python

num = 3
print(type(num))
num = 3.14 
print(type(num))
# we can do both addition, subtraaction, division, multiplication using +,-,/,* respectively.
print(3/2)# this will give you 1.5 we can round it up to whole number by perfoeming floor division using //. it will eliminate the remiander.
print(3//2)

print(3 ** 2) #exponet
print(3 % 2) #modulus

print(3 * 2 + 1)
print(3 * (2 + 1))# using parentesis to tell the computer which operation to run first

#number incremetation
num = 1
num += 1 #this will increse the number by 1
print(num)

num *= 10 #this will multiply the number by 10
print(num)
'''
this is just like saying 
num *= n (where n stands for a particular numner) 
for example
num *= n this will multipy the number by n raise to the number 

num = 5
num *= 6 is 5*6
lets ee it in action.
'''
num = 5
num *= 6
print(num)
